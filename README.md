Babushka Deps for Bootstrapping Teamsquare Servers
=============================================

These babusha deps are a collection of deps from a variety of sources that have been customised for the specific purposes
of managing Teamsquare infrastructure.

The individual deps are (mostly) generic, and Teamsquare specific stuff has (mostly) been isolated to the teamsquare.rb file.

The various deps, config files etc contained may be of use to others.
