Babushka Deps for Bootstrapping Lexim Servers
=============================================

These babusha deps are a collection of deps from a variety of sources that have been customised for the specific purposes
of managing Lexim infrastructure.

The individual deps are (mostly) generic, and Lexim specific stuff has (mostly) been isolated to the lexim.rb file.

The various deps, config files etc contained may be of use to others.
